# GPA

**GPA (Granted Permission Attacks)** is an Android application developed to achieve two main goals:
* **explicit goal (frontend)** : provide useful services for university students
* **implicit goal (backend)** : raise security & privacy awareness for android users


## FRONTEND :sparkles:

## BACKEND (let's hack & spy) :smiling_imp:
A smartphone application requires a set of permissions to be installed. These permissions are confirmed by the end user, who usually do not hesitate to accept them all. However, how dangerous can these permissions be in the hands of the wrong developer?
To show how dangerous the situation is, I created this spyware app that can do pretty much everything:
* extract call logs, SMSs, and contacts
* record audio
* take camera pics
* take screenshots
* turn on/off wifi, bluetooth, camera flashlight, airplane mode...
* track user location
* consume data (internet)
* review device files
* steal files
* change wallpaper
* zombie (for DDOS purposes)
* ... etc

Note that all these can be performed even if the app is not openned and the device screen is off.

Here is a video demonstrating some of these : https://www.dropbox.com/s/rj4283q8lrnxzjy/GPA.mp4?dl=0

Note that this spyware is for educational purposes only, and I am not responsible for any misuse of it.
For privacy issues, I've installed and tested it on my device only.
